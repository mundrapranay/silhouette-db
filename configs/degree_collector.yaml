# Degree Collector Algorithm Configuration
# This is a 2-round algorithm that collects vertex degrees

algorithm_name: degree-collector
algorithm_type: exact

# Silhouette-db server address
server_address: "127.0.0.1:9090"

# Worker configuration
worker_config:
  num_workers: 3
  worker_id: "worker-0"  # Change this for different workers: "worker-0", "worker-1", "worker-2"
  # Optional: Custom vertex-to-worker assignment
  # vertex_assignment:
  #   0: "worker-0"
  #   1: "worker-0"
  #   2: "worker-1"

# Graph input configuration
graph_config:
  # Option 1: Load from file (space or tab separated: u v [weight])
  format: "edgelist"
  
  # Local testing mode: if true, loads from partitioned files based on worker_id
  # (e.g., data/1.txt for worker-0, data/2.txt for worker-1)
  # If false, uses file_path directly (deployment mode where each worker
  # has its own graph file with the same path/name)
  local_testing: true  # Set to false for deployment
  
  # For local_testing=true: Base directory containing partitioned files (e.g., "data")
  # For local_testing=false: Full path to the graph file (same for all workers)
  file_path: "data"  # For local testing: directory containing 1.txt, 2.txt, etc.
  # file_path: "/path/to/graph.txt"  # For deployment: full path to graph file
  
  # Option 2: Specify edges directly in config (alternative to file_path)
  # edges:
  #   - u: 0
  #     v: 1
  #   - u: 1
  #     v: 2
  #   - u: 2
  #     v: 0
  #   - u: 0
  #     v: 2
  
  # Whether graph is directed (for degree calculation)
  directed: false  # Set to true for directed graphs

# Algorithm-specific parameters
parameters:
  # Number of rounds (must be >= 2 for degree-collector)
  num_rounds: 2
  
  # Optional: Custom result file path
  # result_file: "degree_results_worker-0.txt"
  # If not specified, defaults to: degree_collector_results_<worker_id>.txt
